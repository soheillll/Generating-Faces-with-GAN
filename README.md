# Dataset:
We'll be using two datasets in this project:

- MNIST
- CelebA

Since the celebA dataset is complex and we're doing GANs in a project for the first time, we want to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST will allow to see how well your model trains sooner.
